It&#39;s an <strong>object-oriented programming language</strong>, and it&#39;s very <strong>versatile</strong>.</p><p>Now, what do you mean with that weakly type means that we have no explicit type assignment. JavaScript knows types like numbers or text, which is called string or booleans, which is true or false, but it doesn&#39;t force you to define which type you&#39;re using in a variable or in a function. And indeed, you can also have a variable where you store a number which you then suddenly change to a text variable so you can switch types dynamically. In orther languages this is differently. And whilst that gives you greater flexibility to be able to change it and to not have strict typing, it also can lead to errors. So it is just something you have to be aware of.</p><p>Object oriented simply means that data can be origanized in logical objects and will see these objects in this module. And one important concept here is that you have to be aware about the difference of primitive and reference types.</p><p>Regarding the versatility. We can see that JavaScript runs in the browser and this is actually where it comes from, but you can also use it with node.js to run it on your PC outside of a browser set up or also on server day of work. So we got this broad versatility of being able to use JavaScript on different platforms, and you can also perform a broaad variety of tasks with JavaScript. Also, depending on the platform you&#39;re running on, you can in the browser listen to user events, re render the DOMM and on the server or on a PC. You can work with files, wiht databases, alot of cool stuff.</p><p>So this is the summary of JavaScript and what makes up the language.</p><ul><li>Weakly Typed Language <ul><li>No explicit type assignment</li><li>Data types canbe switched dynamically</li></ul></li><li>Object-Oriented Language <ul><li>Data can be organized in logical objects</li><li>Primitive and reference types</li></ul></li><li>Versatile Language <ul><li>Runs in browser &amp; directly on a PC/ server</li><li>Can perform a broad variety of tasks</li></ul></li></ul>',9),o=[n];function s(l,c,h,d,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
