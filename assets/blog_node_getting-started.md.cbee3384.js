It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p><p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p><p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.</p><p>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.</p><p>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.</p><p>In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don&#39;t have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.</p><h2 id="a-node-js-app" tabindex="-1">A Node.js App <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-node-js-app" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/sleepy-sky-5qf7pw?autoresize=1&amp;fontsize=14&amp;theme=dark" style="width:100%;height:500px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;" title="sleepy-sky-5qf7pw" allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>',10),s=[n];function i(d,c,p,l,h,u){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const f=e(r,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
